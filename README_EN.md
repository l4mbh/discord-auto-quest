## ⚠️ Important: Claiming Rewards

**Please Read Carefully:**

Due to the complex and constantly changing nature of Discord's Captcha security systems, **automated claiming is currently not possible**. The "Captcha" challenges are extremely difficult for bots to solve reliably.

**How to Claim:**
We have integrated a secure **Manual Claim Window** to resolve this:

1.  Go to the **"Completed"** tab in the app.
2.  Click the **"Claim in Discord"** button.
3.  A secure, in-app browser window will open.
    -   *The app will automatically log you into your current account.*
4.  Navigate to the Discord Quest/Inventory page in that window.
5.  **Manually click the "Claim Reward" button.**
6.  Once done, close the window to return to the app.

This method ensures you can always claim your rewards safely without getting stuck on impossible Captchas.
